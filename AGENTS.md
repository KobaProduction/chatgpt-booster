# AGENTS.md

Repository map for ChatGPT Booster.

## Start

1. Read `README.md`.
2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before structural changes.
3. Use the universal workflow library routed by the account/project prompt.
4. Keep the project browser-side unless a concrete feature requires a service.

## Repository boundaries

- `packages/core` — environment-neutral runtime contracts and settings.
- `packages/chatgpt` — ChatGPT DOM adapters.
- `packages/features` — reusable feature modules.
- `packages/ui` — Vue/shadcn-vue components and injected UI.
- `packages/extension` — Chromium Manifest V3 target.
- `packages/userscript` — Tampermonkey/userscript target.
- `.github/workflows` — CI and release packaging.

## Hard rules

- ChatGPT page integration must be isolated behind small adapters/modules.
- Injected UI must not depend on ChatGPT's CSS cascade; use Shadow DOM.
- Do not call private ChatGPT APIs unless a feature explicitly requires it and the contract is documented.
- Keep host access limited to ChatGPT.
- Shared feature logic belongs in `core` or a feature module, not duplicated between extension and userscript targets.
- Do not store chat content in telemetry.
- A build passing is not equivalent to runtime validation in ChatGPT.

## Active archive/UI contract

For archive/toolkit changes, read `docs/tasks/DOCKED_ARCHIVE_TOOLKIT.md`; its selective capture and evidence rules supersede the earlier unconditional capture behavior.
